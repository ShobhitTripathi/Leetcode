2948. Make Lexicographically Smallest Array by Swapping Elements

You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers nums and a positive integer limit.

In one operation, you can choose any two indices i and j and swap nums[i] and nums[j] if |nums[i] - nums[j]| <= limit.

Return the lexicographically smallest array that can be obtained by performing the operation any number of times.

An array a is lexicographically smaller than an array b if in the first position where a and b differ, array a has an element that is less than the corresponding element in b. For example, the array [2,10,3] is lexicographically smaller than the array [10,2,3] because they differ at index 0 and 2 < 10.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,5,3,9,8], limit = 2
Output: [1,3,5,8,9]
Explanation: Apply the operation 2 times:
- Swap nums[1] with nums[2]. The array becomes [1,3,5,9,8]
- Swap nums[3] with nums[4]. The array becomes [1,3,5,8,9]
We cannot obtain a lexicographically smaller array by applying any more operations.
Note that it may be possible to get the same result by doing different operations.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,7,6,18,2,1], limit = 3
Output: [1,6,7,18,1,2]
Explanation: Apply the operation 3 times:
- Swap nums[1] with nums[2]. The array becomes [1,6,7,18,2,1]
- Swap nums[0] with nums[4]. The array becomes [2,6,7,18,1,1]
- Swap nums[0] with nums[5]. The array becomes [1,6,7,18,1,2]
We cannot obtain a lexicographically smaller array by applying any more operations.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,7,28,19,10], limit = 3
Output: [1,7,28,19,10]
Explanation: [1,7,28,19,10] is the lexicographically smallest array we can obtain because we cannot apply the operation on any two indices.

```

Algorithm
```
Create a sorted copy of the input array nums called numsSorted.

Initialize variables:

currGroup to track the current group index.
numToGroup, a map to associate each number with its group.
groupToList, a map to associate each group with a list of numbers that belong to it.
Sort the numsSorted array.

Assign the first element of numsSorted to group 0:

Add the element to groupToList under group 0.
Iterate through the rest of numsSorted:

If the difference between the current element and the previous one is greater than limit, increment currGroup (indicating a new group).
Assign the current element to the correct group in numToGroup.
Add the element to the corresponding list in groupToList.
Iterate through the original nums array:

For each element, retrieve its group from numToGroup.
Replace the element with the next element from its corresponding group in groupToList.
Return the modified nums array, which is now the lexicographically smallest array after applying the group-wise sorting.


```

Solution
```java
// Time : O(NLogN), Space: O(N)
class Solution {

    public int[] lexicographicallySmallestArray(int[] nums, int limit) {
        int[] numsSorted = new int[nums.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) numsSorted[i] = nums[i];
        Arrays.sort(numsSorted);

        int currGroup = 0;
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> numToGroup = new HashMap<>();
        numToGroup.put(numsSorted[0], currGroup);

        HashMap<Integer, LinkedList<Integer>> groupToList = new HashMap<>();
        groupToList.put(
            currGroup,
            new LinkedList<Integer>(Arrays.asList(numsSorted[0]))
        );

        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (Math.abs(numsSorted[i] - numsSorted[i - 1]) > limit) {
                // new group
                currGroup++;
            }

            // assign current element to group
            numToGroup.put(numsSorted[i], currGroup);

            // add element to sorted group list
            if (!groupToList.containsKey(currGroup)) {
                groupToList.put(currGroup, new LinkedList<Integer>());
            }
            groupToList.get(currGroup).add(numsSorted[i]);
        }

        // iterate through input and overwrite each element with the next element in its corresponding group
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int num = nums[i];
            int group = numToGroup.get(num);
            nums[i] = groupToList.get(group).pop();
        }

        return nums;
    }
}

```

# 305. Number of Islands II

You are given an empty 2D binary grid grid of size m x n. The grid represents a map where 0's represent water and 1's represent land. 
Initially, all the cells of grid are water cells (i.e., all the cells are 0's).

We may perform an add land operation which turns the water at position into a land. 
You are given an array positions where positions[i] = [ri, ci] is the position (ri, ci) at which we should operate the ith operation.

Return an array of integers answer where answer[i] is the number of islands after turning the cell (ri, ci) into a land.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. 
You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

 
Example 1:
Input: m = 3, n = 3, positions = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,2],[2,1]]
Output: [1,1,2,3]
Explanation:
Initially, the 2d grid is filled with water.
- Operation #1: addLand(0, 0) turns the water at grid[0][0] into a land. We have 1 island.
- Operation #2: addLand(0, 1) turns the water at grid[0][1] into a land. We still have 1 island.
- Operation #3: addLand(1, 2) turns the water at grid[1][2] into a land. We have 2 islands.
- Operation #4: addLand(2, 1) turns the water at grid[2][1] into a land. We have 3 islands.

Example 2:
Input: m = 1, n = 1, positions = [[0,0]]
Output: [1]
 
Constraints:
1 <= m, n, positions.length <= 104
1 <= m * n <= 104
positions[i].length == 2
0 <= ri < m
0 <= ci < n

Algorithm
Initialize arrays x[] = { -1, 1, 0, 0 } and y[] = { 0, 0, -1, 1 } to be used to find neighbors of a cell.
Create an instance of UnionFind, say dsu(m * n). Initialize all parents to -1. We will use union by rank, so initialize all ranks to 0. Lastly, initialize count = 0.
Create a list of integers answer where answer[i] would store the number of islands formed after converting position[i] cell to land.
Iterate through positions and for every position in positions;
Perform a linear mapping to convert a 2D cell position to landPosition = position[0] * n + position[1].
Use the addLand(landPosition) operation to add landPosition as a node to the graph. This function will also increment count.
Iterate over every neighbor of position. A neighbor can be determined using neighborX = position[0] + x[i] and neighborY = position[1] + y[i], where neighborX is the X-coordinate and neighborY is the Y-coordinate of the neighboring cell. We perform a linear mapping of the neighboring cell using neighborPosition = neighborX * n + neighborY. Now, if there is a land at neighborPosition, i.e., isLand(neighborPosition) returns true, we perform union of neighborPosition and landPosition. In union we will decrement the count by 1.
Perform the numberofIslands operation which returns the number of islands formed after coverting position to land. Add it to answer.
Return answer.

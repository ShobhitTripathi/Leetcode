# 1004. Max Consecutive Ones III

Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.

 Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
 
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 105
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
0 <= k <= nums.length

```approach
We keep expanding the window by moving the right pointer.
When the window has reached the limit of 0's allowed,
we contract (if possible) and save the longest window till now.

```


```java
Time Complexity: O(N)
class Solution {
    public int longestOnes(int[] nums, int k) {
        int left = 0;
        int curr = 0;
        int ans = 0;
        for (int right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
            if (nums[right] == 0) {
                curr++;
            }

            while (curr > k) {
                if (nums[left] == 0) {
                    curr--;
                }

                left++;
            }

            ans = Math.max(ans, right - left + 1);
        }     

        return ans;
    }
}
```

/*
In Java, a singleton is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object. 
It ensures that only one instance of the class is created throughout the application and provides a global point of access to it.

In this example, the Singleton class has a private constructor to prevent direct instantiation from outside the class. 
The getInstance() method is used to create and return the singleton instance. 
It checks if the instance is null and creates a new instance if it is.
*/

public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;
    
    private Singleton() {
        // private constructor to prevent instantiation from outside the class
    }
    
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
    
    // other methods and variables
}

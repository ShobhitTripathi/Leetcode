/*
You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times.

Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
Example 2:

Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of only uppercase English letters.
0 <= k <= s.length

        int maxFrequency = 0;
        int longestSubstringLength = 0;
        int start = 0;

        for (int end = 0;end < s.length();end++) {
            int currentChar = s.charAt(end) - 'A';
            frequencyMap[currentChar] += 1;

            maxFrequency = Math.max(maxFrequency, frequencyMap[currentChar]);

            boolean isValid = (end + 1 - start - maxFrequency <= k);

            if (!isValid) {
                int outgoingChar = s.charAt(start) - 'A';
                frequencyMap[outgoingChar] -= 1;
                start += 1;
            }
            longestSubstringLength = end + 1 - start;

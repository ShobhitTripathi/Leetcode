# 2812. Find the Safest Path in a Grid

You are given a 0-indexed 2D matrix grid of size n x n, where (r, c) represents:

A cell containing a thief if grid[r][c] = 1
An empty cell if grid[r][c] = 0
You are initially positioned at cell (0, 0). In one move, you can move to any adjacent cell in the grid, including cells containing thieves.

The safeness factor of a path on the grid is defined as the minimum manhattan distance from any cell in the path to any thief in the grid.

Return the maximum safeness factor of all paths leading to cell (n - 1, n - 1).

An adjacent cell of cell (r, c), is one of the cells (r, c + 1), (r, c - 1), (r + 1, c) and (r - 1, c) if it exists.

The Manhattan distance between two cells (a, b) and (x, y) is equal to |a - x| + |b - y|, where |val| denotes the absolute value of val.

 Example 1:
```
Input: grid = [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 0
Explanation: All paths from (0, 0) to (n - 1, n - 1) go through the thieves in cells (0, 0) and (n - 1, n - 1).
```
Example 2:
```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The path depicted in the picture above has a safeness factor of 2 since:
- The closest cell of the path to the thief at cell (0, 2) is cell (0, 0). The distance between them is | 0 - 0 | + | 0 - 2 | = 2.
It can be shown that there are no other paths with a higher safeness factor.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The path depicted in the picture above has a safeness factor of 2 since:
- The closest cell of the path to the thief at cell (0, 3) is cell (1, 2). The distance between them is | 0 - 1 | + | 3 - 2 | = 2.
- The closest cell of the path to the thief at cell (3, 0) is cell (3, 2). The distance between them is | 3 - 3 | + | 0 - 2 | = 2.
It can be shown that there are no other paths with a higher safeness factor.
```

Constraints:
```
1 <= grid.length == n <= 400
grid[i].length == n
grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
There is at least one thief in the grid.
```

High-Level Intuition\
```
The problem asks for a path from (0,0) to (n-1,n-1) such that the minimum distance to any thief along the path is maximized.
This is a maximin path problem.
```

Step-by-Step Strategy
```
Step 1: Convert to distance grid
  Treat all thief cells as sources
  Use multi-source BFS
  mat[i][j] stores distance to nearest thief
  This ensures:
  Every cell knows how “safe” it is.

Step 2: Binary search on answer
  Minimum safeness = 0
  Maximum safeness = max value in mat
  For a guessed safeness mid, check:
  Is there a path using only cells with value ≥ mid?

Step 3: Path validation using BFS
  Standard BFS from (0,0)
  Only move through cells where distance ≥ mid
  If destination is reachable → valid safeness

Why Binary Search Works
  If a path exists for safeness k,
  then it must exist for all values < k.
  
  This monotonic property allows binary search.
```

Complexity
```
Multi-source BFS:   O(n²)
Binary search:      O(log n)
Each validation BFS: O(n²)

Total: O(n² log n)
```
